## How to Use the Python Interpreter
To begin working with Python:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your installation) to enter the Python interpreter.
3. In the prompt (`>>>`), type and execute Python commands directly.
   - Example:
     ```python
     >>> print("Hello, World!")
     Hello, World!
     ```

To execute Python scripts, save your code to a file (e.g., `script.py`) and run it:
```bash
python script.py
