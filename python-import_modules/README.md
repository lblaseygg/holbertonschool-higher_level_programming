Python Programming: Functions and Modules
Project Overview
This project aims to teach fundamental Python programming concepts, including working with functions, importing and using functions from other files, and understanding how to structure Python programs effectively. You will explore creating modules, using command-line arguments, and mastering key built-in functions such as dir(). By the end of the project, you will be able to explain these concepts and apply them to real-world Python programming tasks.

Learning Objectives
General Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be expected to:

Understand why Python programming is awesome.
Be proficient in importing functions from another file.
Know how to use imported functions effectively.
Understand the process of creating a module in Python.
Be familiar with using the dir() function, a powerful built-in function.
Learn how to prevent code from being executed when your Python file is imported.
Understand how to use command-line arguments to interact with your Python programs.
Detailed Objectives
Why Python Programming is Awesome

You'll gain an appreciation of Python's simple syntax, versatility, and readability. You'll understand why Python is considered a powerful and accessible language for both beginners and experienced developers.
Importing Functions from Another File

You will learn how to split your code into multiple files (modules) and how to import functions from those files into your current Python script. This is important for code organization and reusability.
How to Use Imported Functions

After importing functions from other files or modules, you’ll explore how to invoke and utilize those functions within your script. You'll understand the benefits of modularity and function reuse.
Creating a Module

You will practice creating your own Python modules by writing reusable functions, organizing them in separate Python files, and accessing them as libraries in other scripts.
Using the Built-In Function dir()

The dir() function allows you to examine the available attributes (such as functions or variables) in a module or object. You will use it to learn more about Python objects and modules.
Preventing Code Execution When Imported

Learn how to structure your Python scripts so that code is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it’s imported into another file. This is accomplished using the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
Using Command-Line Arguments

You’ll learn how to pass arguments to your Python programs from the command line using the sys.argv method. This is essential for building programs that can handle user input dynamically from the terminal.
