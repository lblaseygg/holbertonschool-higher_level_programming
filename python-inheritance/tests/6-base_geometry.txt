Module: base_geometry.py

Description:
    This module defines a base geometry class `BaseGeometry`. 
    The class serves as a foundation for geometric shapes and includes 
    a placeholder method `area` that must be implemented by subclasses.

Class:
    - BaseGeometry: A base class for geometric operations.

Prototype:
    class BaseGeometry:

Methods:
    - area(self): Raises an Exception indicating it is not implemented.

Behavior:
    - The `area` method is intended to be overridden by subclasses.
    - Calling `area()` directly on an instance of `BaseGeometry` will 
      raise an `Exception` with the message `"area() is not implemented"`.

Example usage:
    bg = BaseGeometry()
    try:
        bg.area()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)  # Output: area() is not implemented

Test cases:
    - isinstance(BaseGeometry(), BaseGeometry) → True
    - issubclass(BaseGeometry, object) → True
    - Calling BaseGeometry().area() raises Exception → True
