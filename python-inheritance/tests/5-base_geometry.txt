Module: base_geometry.py

Description:
    This module defines an empty class `BaseGeometry`. 
    It serves as a foundation for future geometric classes.

Class:
    - BaseGeometry: A placeholder class representing basic geometry.

Prototype:
    class BaseGeometry:

Behavior:
    - The class is currently empty, using the `pass` statement.
    - It can be extended with methods and attributes in the future.

Example usage:
    bg = BaseGeometry()
    print(type(bg))  # Output: <class '__main__.BaseGeometry'>

Test cases:
    - isinstance(BaseGeometry(), BaseGeometry) → True
    - issubclass(BaseGeometry, object) → True
